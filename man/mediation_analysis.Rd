\title{Perform Mediation Analysis}
\usage{
mediation_analysis(
  data,
  columns,
  nrep = 1000,
  output_file,
  num_threads = parallel::detectCores()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A `data.table` or `data.frame` containing the data.  If a `data.frame` is provided, it will be converted to a `data.table` internally.}

\item{columns}{A list with three named elements: `exposure`, `mediator`, and `outcome`. Each element should be a character vector containing the prefixes of the column names for the corresponding variables. For example, if your exposure variables are named "Exposure_1", "Exposure_2", etc., the `exposure` element should be `"Exposure"`.}

\item{nrep}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap replicates to perform.  Higher values generally lead to more stable estimates but increase computation time. Default is 1000.}

\item{output_file}{A character string specifying the path to the output CSV file.  Results are written to this file in real-time.  The file will be overwritten if it already exists.}

\item{num_threads}{An integer specifying the number of threads to use for parallel processing.  Default is the number of available cores detected by `parallel::detectCores()`.}
}
\value{
None.  The results are written to the specified `output_file` in CSV format.
}
\description{
This function performs mediation analysis using bootstrap resampling to estimate direct, indirect, and total effects.  It processes data in chunks to handle large datasets efficiently and writes results directly to a CSV file.
}
\details{
This function estimates the following effects:
* **Indirect Effect (t1):**  The effect of the exposure on the outcome through the mediator when the exposure is set to its value at t=1 (typically meaning its presence or a higher level).
* **Indirect Effect (t0):** The effect of the exposure on the outcome through the mediator when the exposure is set to its value at t=0 (typically meaning its absence or a lower level).
* **Direct Effect (t1):** The effect of the exposure on the outcome not through the mediator when the exposure is set to t=1.
* **Direct Effect (t0):** The effect of the exposure on the outcome not through the mediator when the exposure is set to t=0.
* **Total Effect:**  The total effect of the exposure on the outcome, both direct and indirect.

The output CSV file includes estimates, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals (LCB, UCB), and p-values for each effect and combination of variables.
